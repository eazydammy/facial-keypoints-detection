# Facial Keypoints Detection
 Combines knowledge of computer vision and deep learning (CNNs) to build dectection system for facial keypoints including points around the eyes, nose, and mouth. It has several applications including facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. The completed code is able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of facial keypoints on each face; examples of these keypoints are displayed below.

The project is broken up into a few main parts in four Python notebooks:

__Notebook 1__ : Loading and Visualizing the Facial Keypoint Data

__Notebook 2__ : Defining and Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to Predict Facial Keypoints

__Notebook 3__ : Facial Keypoint Detection Using Haar Cascades and the Trained CNN

__Notebook 4__ : Fun Filters and Keypoint Uses
